## üîç Key Findings

### 1. **No School Data in Database**
All school-related tables are currently empty. This means:
- No daily school scores have been entered
- No academic credits have been recorded
- No grades have been logged
- No academic steps have been tracked
- No school incident reports have been filed

### 2. **Youth Records Exist**
The system has **10 youth** registered, which means the application is set up and ready to receive school data.

### 3. **LocalStorage Check Required**
Data may exist in the browser's localStorage cache. To check:
1. Open `check-localstorage-data.html` in your browser
2. Make sure you're using the same browser where you access the application
3. The page will show any cached school scores

## üéØ Rating Scale (UI Display)

The School Scores page uses a **0-4 rating scale** for daily scores:

| Score | Label | Color |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 3.5 - 4.0 | Exceeding Expectations | üü¢ Green |
| 3.0 - 3.4 | Meeting Expectations | üîµ Blue |
| 2.0 - 2.9 | Needs Improvement | üü° Yellow |
| 0.0 - 1.9 | Unsatisfactory | üî¥ Red |

**Note:** Scores are stored as 0-100 in the database but displayed as 0-4 in the UI.

## üíæ Data Storage Architecture

### Hybrid Storage System
The application uses a dual-storage approach:

1. **Primary Storage: Supabase Database**
   - Source of truth for all data
   - Persistent across devices
   - Supports multi-user access

2. **Local Cache: Browser localStorage**
   - Key: `heartland_school_scores`
   - Fast read access
   - Offline capability
   - Syncs with database

### Sync Strategy
- **Writes:** Optimistic updates to both localStorage and Supabase
- **Reads:** Prefer localStorage for speed
- **Background Sync:** Every 10 seconds (with cooldown)
- **Conflict Resolution:** Remote (Supabase) data is source of truth

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Add Data

### Option 1: Via Application UI
1. Navigate to `/school` in the application
2. Click on "School Scores" tab
3. Enter scores for each youth (0-4 scale)
4. Data auto-saves after 200ms

### Option 2: Via Database Import
Use the provided sample data generator (see next section)

### Option 3: Via API
```javascript
import { schoolScoresService } from '@/integrations/supabase/schoolScoresService'

await schoolScoresService.upsert(
  'youth-id-uuid',
  '2025-01-20', // ISO date
  1, // weekday (1=Mon, 5=Fri)
  85 // score (0-100)
)
```
