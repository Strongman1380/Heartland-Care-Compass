# Incident Reporting System - Heartland Boys Home

## Overview

A comprehensive, trauma-informed incident reporting system designed specifically for residential youth care facilities. This system prioritizes security, privacy, accessibility, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Features

### âœ… Core Functionality
- **Comprehensive Incident Documentation**: Capture all aspects of incidents including antecedents, behaviors, and consequences
- **Multi-Step Form**: Organized into logical sections (Basic Info, Details, Actions, Attachments, Signatures)
- **Autosave**: Automatic draft saving every 3 seconds to prevent data loss
- **File Attachments**: Support for images and PDFs with client-side preview (10MB total limit)
- **Digital Signatures**: Touch/mouse signature capture with timestamp
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicator showing form completion

### ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive data (youth names, DOB, medical details) encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- **SSN Protection**: Never stores plain SSN; uses SHA-256 hash only
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Three roles - staff, supervisor, admin
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all create/update/view/export actions
- **Anonymized Exports**: Option to export reports with PII redacted
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication

### â™¿ Accessibility
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant**: Meets accessibility standards
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support throughout
- **Screen Reader Friendly**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Error Messages**: Clear, inline validation messages
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order and focus indicators

### ðŸŽ¨ Trauma-Informed Design
- **Non-Judgmental Language**: Helper text encourages objective documentation
- **Clear Instructions**: Guidance at every step
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clean, organized interface reduces cognitive load
- **Progress Feedback**: Users always know where they are in the process

## Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18.3.1** with TypeScript
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **Tailwind CSS** + shadcn/ui components
- **Date-fns** for date handling

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js 20.x** with Express
- **MongoDB** for data storage
- **JWT** for authentication
- **Multer** for file uploads
- **Crypto** (Node.js built-in) for encryption

## Security Best Practices

### Encryption Key Management

**Initial Setup**
```bash
# Generate a new master key
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"

# Add to .env
ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=<generated-key>
```

**Key Rotation** (See Runbook below)

### Access Control

**Role Permissions**:
- **Staff**: Create/edit own drafts, view own incidents
- **Supervisor**: View/edit all incidents, approve submissions
- **Admin**: Full access including user management and exports

### Data Protection

1. **Never log sensitive data** in application logs
2. **Use HTTPS** in production (enforced)
3. **Validate all inputs** server-side
4. **Sanitize outputs** to prevent XSS
5. **Rate limit** API endpoints
6. **Regular backups** of encrypted data

## Support

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Autosave not working
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, ensure stable internet connection

**Issue**: Signature not capturing
**Solution**: Ensure browser supports HTML5 Canvas, try different browser

**Issue**: File upload fails
**Solution**: Check file size (<5MB per file, <10MB total), verify file type

**Issue**: Cannot view incident
**Solution**: Verify user has appropriate role and permissions

### Getting Help
