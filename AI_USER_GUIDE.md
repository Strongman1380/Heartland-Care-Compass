## Using AI to Expand Notes

### In Case Notes

When creating case notes, you can use the AI to expand brief notes:

**How to Use:**
1. Type brief notes in any text field (e.g., "youth angry, refused activities, calmed after 20 min")
2. Click the **sparkle icon** (‚ú®) next to the field
3. AI will expand your notes into 2-3 professional sentences

**Example:**

**Your Input:**
```
youth angry, refused activities, calmed after 20 min
```

**AI Output:**
```
The youth displayed anger and initially refused to participate in scheduled activities. 
After approximately 20 minutes and staff intervention, the youth was able to regulate 
their emotions and returned to a calm state. This demonstrates some capacity for 
emotional regulation with appropriate support.
```

**Tips:**
- Keep your notes brief but include key facts
- Include important details like times, behaviors, and outcomes
- The AI won't add information you didn't mention
- You can always edit the AI's output

## Using AI for Data Analysis

### AI Query Interface

Access the AI Query Interface from the main navigation to ask data-related questions.

**Example Questions:**

**Calculate Statistics:**
- "Calculate the average behavior points for this month"
- "What's the median rating for the last 30 days?"
- "Show me the standard deviation in behavior points"

**Analyze Trends:**
- "What's the trend in daily ratings over the last week?"
- "Is behavior improving or declining?"
- "Calculate the percentage change in points this month"

**Distribution Analysis:**
- "Show me the distribution of incidents by type"
- "What percentage of youth improved their ratings?"
- "How many youth are at each level?"

**Comparative Analysis:**
- "Compare this week's performance to last week"
- "Which youth have the highest improvement rate?"
- "What's the average across all youth?"

### Behavioral Insights

When viewing a youth's profile, you can generate behavioral insights:

**What You Get:**
- **Calculated Statistics**: Average, median, standard deviation
- **Trend Analysis**: Improving, declining, or stable with numbers
- **Consistency Rating**: How variable the behavior is
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Based on the actual numbers

**How to Use:**
1. Navigate to a youth's profile
2. Click "AI Assist" button
3. Select "Calculate Behavior Trends"
4. Review the statistical analysis

**Example Output:**
```
CALCULATED STATISTICS:
- Average daily points: 42.3
- Median points: 44.0
- Standard deviation: 8.2
- Overall trend: +5.5 (Improving)
- Consistency: Moderate

ANALYSIS:
The youth shows a positive trend with an increase of 5.5 points over the period.
The moderate standard deviation (8.2) indicates some variability in daily 
performance, suggesting external factors may influence behavior. The median 
being higher than the mean suggests recent improvement...
```

## Troubleshooting

### "AI service not available"
- Check that OPENAI_API_KEY is configured
- Verify internet connection
- Contact administrator if issue persists

### "Please enter some text first"
- You need to type something before clicking enhance
- The AI needs at least a few words to expand

### AI output is too generic
- Provide more specific details in your notes
- Include numbers, times, and concrete observations
- The AI can only work with what you give it

### AI didn't calculate correctly
- Verify the data is available in the system
- Try rephrasing your question
- Ask for specific calculations (e.g., "average" instead of "typical")
