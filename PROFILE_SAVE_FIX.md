# Youth Profile Save Issue - Analysis and Fix

## Status: ✅ FIXED

## Problem
Youth profile data doesn't persist after editing. Getting 400 errors from Supabase.

## Root Cause
**Type Mismatch**: EditYouthDialog is sending data types that don't match the Supabase schema.

### Schema Expectations (from types.ts):
- `legalGuardian`: `Json` (object)
- `probationOfficer`: `Json` (object)
- `father`: `Json` (object)
- `mother`: `Json` (object)
- `caseworker`: `Json` (object)
- `guardianAdLitem`: `Json` (object)
- `address`: `Json` (object)
- `physicalDescription`: `Json` (object)

### Current Issue:
EditYouthDialog sends:
- `legalGuardian`: string (should be Json object)
- `probationOfficer`: string (should be Json object)

## Solution - ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Fix 1: ✅ Updated EditYouthDialog.tsx (line ~380-390)

Changed FROM:
```typescript
legalGuardian: formData.legalGuardian || null,
probationOfficer: formData.probationOfficer || null,
```

Change TO:
```typescript
legalGuardian: formData.legalGuardian ? {
  name: formData.legalGuardian,
  relationship: formData.guardianRelationship || null,
  contact: formData.guardianContact || null,
  phone: formData.guardianPhone || null,
  email: formData.guardianEmail || null
} : null,
probationOfficer: formData.probationOfficer ? {
  name: formData.probationOfficer,
  contact: formData.probationContact || null,
  phone: formData.probationPhone || null
} : null,
```

### Fix 2: ✅ Updated youth form data population (line ~68-91)

Changed FROM:
```typescript
legalGuardian: youth.legalGuardian || "",
probationOfficer: youth.probationOfficer || "",
```

Change TO:
```typescript
legalGuardian: typeof youth.legalGuardian === 'object' && youth.legalGuardian?.name
  ? youth.legalGuardian.name
  : (typeof youth.legalGuardian === 'string' ? youth.legalGuardian : ""),
probationOfficer: typeof youth.probationOfficer === 'object' && youth.probationOfficer?.name
  ? youth.probationOfficer.name
  : (typeof youth.probationOfficer === 'string' ? youth.probationOfficer : ""),
guardianRelationship: typeof youth.legalGuardian === 'object' && youth.legalGuardian?.relationship
  ? youth.legalGuardian.relationship
  : (youth.guardianRelationship || ""),
guardianContact: typeof youth.legalGuardian === 'object' && youth.legalGuardian?.contact
  ? youth.legalGuardian.contact
  : (youth.guardianContact || ""),
guardianPhone: typeof youth.legalGuardian === 'object' && youth.legalGuardian?.phone
  ? youth.legalGuardian.phone
  : (youth.guardianPhone || ""),
guardianEmail: typeof youth.legalGuardian === 'object' && youth.legalGuardian?.email
  ? youth.legalGuardian.email
  : (youth.guardianEmail || ""),
probationContact: typeof youth.probationOfficer === 'object' && youth.probationOfficer?.contact
  ? youth.probationOfficer.contact
  : (youth.probationContact || ""),
probationPhone: typeof youth.probationOfficer === 'object' && youth.probationOfficer?.phone
  ? youth.probationOfficer.phone
  : (youth.probationPhone || ""),
```

### Fix 3: ✅ Updated AddYouthDialog.tsx (line ~300-314)

Applied the same Json object formatting to AddYouthDialog.tsx to ensure new youth profiles are created with the correct data structure.
