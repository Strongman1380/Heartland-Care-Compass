Core Behavioral Assessment System:

1. Daily Points Calculation (src/components/youth/ConsolidatedScoringTab.tsx)
- Four-domain behavioral scoring (0-4 scale):
  * Peer Interaction (P)
  * Adult Interaction (A) 
  * Investment Level (I)
  * Deal with Authority (D)
- Daily total calculation: Sum of 4 domains x multiplier (max 105 points)
- Period-based weighted averages for shift variations
- Conflict detection for multiple shift ratings

2. Level Progression Engine (src/utils/levelSystem.ts)
- 11-tier level system (0-10) with point thresholds
- Level advancement requirements:
  * Minimum days at current level
  * Required point average maintenance
  * No major incidents within timeframe
- Demotion triggers based on:
  * Point average drops below threshold
  * Critical behavioral incidents
  * Consecutive days below minimum score

3. Risk Assessment Integration (src/services/assessment/RiskCalculator.ts)
- HYRNA scoring implementation for risk evaluation
- Domain-specific weightings:
  * Behavioral History (30%)
  * Social Factors (25%)
  * Clinical Indicators (25%)
  * Environmental Risk (20%)
- Threshold-based risk level assignment:
  * Critical: 85-100%
  * High: 70-84%
  * Moderate: 50-69%
  * Low: 0-49%

4. AI-Enhanced Behavioral Analysis (src/utils/scoring/AIScoring.ts)
- Pattern recognition across behavioral domains
- Trigger identification in behavioral sequences
- Response effectiveness scoring
- Treatment recommendation generation
- Behavioral trend prediction

5. Behavioral Score Aggregation (src/components/behavior/ScoreProcessor.ts)
- Rolling averages across multiple timeframes
- Weighted scoring based on incident severity
- Progress trend calculation with regression analysis
- Performance benchmark comparison

Domain-Specific Features:
- Youth care facility compliance tracking
- Treatment-focused scoring metrics
- Clinical progress indicators
- Behavioral intervention effectiveness measures
