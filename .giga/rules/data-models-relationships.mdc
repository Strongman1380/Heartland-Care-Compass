# data-models-relationships

Core Data Models:

1. Youth Profile Schema
- Hierarchical structure for youth records
```typescript
interface YouthProfile {
  personalInfo: {
    id: string          // Format: HBH-YYYY-NNN
    legalStatus: string // Active|Discharged|OnLeave
    guardianRelations: GuardianRelation[]
    medicalInfo: EncryptedMedicalData
  }
  behavioralTracking: {
    dailyScores: DomainScore[]  // P.A.I.D scoring domains
    riskLevel: RiskAssessment
    realColors: PersonalityProfile
    incidents: IncidentReport[]
  }
  academicProgress: {
    credits: SubjectCredits[]
    weeklyScores: WeeklyScore[] // Thu-Wed periods
    behaviorPoints: PointRecord[]
  }
}
```

2. Behavioral Assessment Models
```typescript
interface DomainScore {
  peerInteraction: number    // 0-4 scale
  adultInteraction: number   // 0-4 scale  
  investmentLevel: number    // 0-4 scale
  dealWithAuthority: number  // 0-4 scale
  timestamp: Date
  shift: ShiftType
}

interface RiskAssessment {
  overallScore: number
  domains: {
    aggression: number
    substanceUse: number 
    flightRisk: number
    selfHarm: number
  }
  recommendedLevel: number
}
```

3. Academic Progress Schema
```typescript
interface AcademicRecord {
  studentId: string
  weeklyAverages: {
    startDate: Date         // Always Thursday
    endDate: Date          // Always Wednesday
    scores: SubjectScore[]
    behaviorPoints: number
  }[]
  credits: {
    subject: string
    earned: number
    required: number
    completionDate?: Date
  }[]
}
```

Key Relationships:
1. Youth Profile -> Guardian Relations (1:N)
2. Youth Profile -> Daily Scores (1:N)
3. Youth Profile -> Academic Records (1:1)
4. Youth Profile -> Incident Reports (1:N)
5. Academic Records -> Weekly Scores (1:N)
6. Behavioral Scores -> Shift Records (N:1)

Data Integrity Rules:
1. All youth records require active guardian relation
2. Academic weeks strictly follow Thu-Wed schedule
3. Daily scores require entries from all shifts
4. Risk assessments trigger level review
5. Incident reports link to behavioral scores
