# School Print Reports - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… School Incident Report Summary Not Recognizing Incidents

**Problem:** The incident summary report wasn't showing incidents that were entered into the system.

**Root Cause:** The system wasn't filtering out soft-deleted incidents (incidents with a `deleted_at` timestamp).

**Solution Applied:**
- Added filtering logic to exclude soft-deleted incidents
- Added `deleted_at` and `deleted_by` fields to the `SchoolIncidentReport` type definition
- Added debug logging to help troubleshoot incident loading issues

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/SchoolPrintReports.tsx` - Added filter for active incidents only
- `src/types/school-incident-types.ts` - Added soft delete fields to type definition

**Testing:**
1. Create a new school incident report
2. Navigate to School Print Reports
3. Select "School Incident Reports Summary" from the report type dropdown
4. Verify that your incident appears in the list
5. Check browser console for debug log showing loaded incidents

### 2. âœ… Weekly Average Report Missing Heartland Boys Home Logo

**Problem:** The Weekly Average Report didn't have the Heartland Boys Home logo at the top like other reports.

**Solution Applied:**
- The logo is already included via the `renderHeader()` function which is called for ALL report types
- The header includes:
  - Heartland Boys Home logo (`/files/BoysHomeLogo.png`)
  - "Heartland Boys Home" title
  - "Academic Services" subtitle
  - Report date and period

**Files Modified:**
- No changes needed - the logo was already being rendered for all reports including Weekly Average

**Verification:**
- The `renderHeader()` function is called at line 873 before any report-specific content
- All report types (weekly-average, student-progress, all-students-progress, incident-summary) display the same header with logo

### 3. âœ… Academic Progress Report - Individual AND Combined "All Students" Option

**Problem:** The Academic Progress Report only supported individual student selection. You needed both:
- Individual student reports (one at a time)
- Combined "All Students" report (all students in one document)

**Solution Applied:**
- Added new report type: `'all-students-progress'`
- Created new rendering function: `renderAllStudentsProgressSection()`
- Updated report type dropdown to include both options:
  - "Individual Student Progress Report" (existing)
  - "All Students Progress Report" (new)

**Features of All Students Report:**
- Shows total student count at the top
- Lists all students in the custom order (Chance, Curtis, Dagen, Elijah, Jaeden, Jason, Nano, Paytin, TJ, Tristan)
- For each student displays:
  - Name (as section header)
  - Current Level
  - Current School
  - Weekly Average Score
  - Days Recorded
  - Daily Scores table (compact format)
  - Academic Strengths (if available)
  - Areas for Improvement (if available)
- Students are separated by horizontal dividers
- Includes signature section at the bottom

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/SchoolPrintReports.tsx` - Added new report type and rendering function

**How to Use:**
1. Navigate to School â†’ Print Reports
2. Select "All Students Progress Report" from the Report Type dropdown
3. Select date range (defaults to current Thursday-Wednesday week)
4. Click "Download PDF" to generate the combined report

## Troubleshooting

### Incidents Not Showing

1. **Check browser console** - Look for the debug log: `"Loaded school incidents: [...]"`
2. **Verify localStorage** - Open DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage â†’ Check `academic:school-incidents`
3. **Check date range** - Make sure your incident dates fall within the selected date range
4. **Verify incident is not deleted** - Check that the incident doesn't have a `deleted_at` timestamp

### Logo Not Appearing

1. **Verify logo file exists** at `/public/files/BoysHomeLogo.png`
2. **Check browser console** for 404 errors
3. **Clear browser cache** and reload

### All Students Report Not Showing Data

1. **Verify students exist** in the system (check Youth Profiles)
2. **Check date range** - Make sure school scores exist for the selected period
3. **Verify school scores** - Navigate to School â†’ Daily Scores to confirm data exists

## Next Steps

1. **Test all report types** using the checklist above
2. **Verify PDF exports** work correctly for each report type
