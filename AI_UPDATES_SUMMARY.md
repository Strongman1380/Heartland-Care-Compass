# AI Functionality Updates Summary

## Overview
Updated the AI functionality to focus on two primary use cases:
1. **Text Expansion**: Converting brief notes/keywords into professional paragraphs
2. **Data Analysis**: Assisting with calculations, distributions, and statistical insights

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend - EnhancedCaseNotes Component
**File**: `src/components/notes/EnhancedCaseNotes.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Updated `getEnhancementPrompt()` function to focus on **expanding brief notes** rather than rewriting existing content
- Changed prompts to emphasize: "Take these brief notes and expand them into a clear, professional paragraph"
- Limited expansion to 2-3 well-written sentences
- Removed language about "enhancing" or "elaborating" existing detailed content

**Impact**: 
- AI now treats input as brief notes/keywords that need expansion
- Maintains original facts and meaning while adding structure
- More predictable output length (2-3 sentences)

### 2. Frontend - AIQueryInterface Component
**File**: `src/components/ai/AIQueryInterface.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Updated placeholder text: "Ask me to analyze data, calculate statistics, or expand your notes..."
- Changed default suggestions to focus on data analysis:
  - "Calculate the average behavior points for this month"
  - "What percentage of youth improved their ratings this week?"
  - "Show me the distribution of incidents by type"
  - "Calculate the trend in daily ratings over the last 30 days"
- Updated welcome message to emphasize data calculations and text expansion

**Impact**:
- Users are guided toward appropriate AI use cases
- Clear expectations about what the AI can help with

### 3. Frontend - AIAssistButton Component
**File**: `src/components/ai/AIAssistButton.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Updated menu labels for clarity:
  - "Summarize Content" → "Condense to Key Points"
  - "Get Writing Suggestions" → "Suggest Content Ideas"
  - "Behavioral Insights" → "Calculate Behavior Trends"
- Changed menu header from "AI Features" to "AI Assistance"

**Impact**:
- Clearer communication about what each AI feature does
- Emphasizes data calculation aspect of behavioral insights

### 4. Backend - Query Endpoint
**File**: `server-new.js` - `/api/ai/query` endpoint

**Changes**:
- Added logic to detect text expansion vs. data analysis requests
- **Text Expansion Mode** (when `context.fieldType` or `context.currentText` exists):
  - System prompt: "Take brief notes or keywords and expand them into clear, well-written paragraphs (2-3 sentences)"
  - Max tokens: 300
  - Temperature: 0.5
  - Emphasizes: Keep original meaning, don't add new information
  
- **Data Analysis Mode** (default):
  - System prompt: "Help with data calculations, distributions, statistical analysis, and insights"
  - Max tokens: 1000
  - Temperature: 0.3
  - Emphasizes: Show calculations and reasoning

**Impact**:
- AI behavior adapts based on request type
- Text expansion is constrained and focused
- Data analysis provides detailed calculations

### 5. Backend - Behavioral Insights
**File**: `server-new.js` - `generateBehavioralInsightsPrompt()` function

**Changes**:
- Added statistical calculations:
  - Median points
  - Standard deviation
  - Variance
  - Consistency rating (High/Moderate/Variable)
- Updated prompt to emphasize "statistical patterns and data-driven insights"
- Changed system prompt to: "You are a data analyst specializing in behavioral statistics"
- Requests focus on:
  - Statistical interpretation
  - Data-driven pattern analysis
  - Quantitative comparisons
  - Measurable goals

**Impact**:
- More robust statistical analysis
- AI responses focus on numbers and calculations
- Provides quantifiable insights rather than general observations

## Key Principles Applied

### Text Enhancement
- **Input**: Brief notes, keywords, or short phrases
- **Output**: 2-3 professional sentences
- **Constraint**: Don't add information not implied in original notes
- **Purpose**: Help staff quickly write professional documentation

### Data Analysis
- **Input**: Numerical data, behavior points, ratings, etc.
- **Output**: Statistical calculations, trends, distributions
- **Constraint**: Show calculations and reasoning
- **Purpose**: Help staff understand patterns and make data-driven decisions

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Text Expansion
1. Enter brief notes like "youth angry today, refused activities"
2. Click enhance button
3. Verify output is 2-3 sentences that expand on the notes without adding new facts

### Test Data Analysis
1. Use AI Query Interface
2. Ask: "Calculate the average behavior points for the last week"
3. Verify response includes actual calculations and numbers
4. Ask: "What's the trend in ratings?" and verify statistical analysis

### Test Behavioral Insights
1. Generate behavioral insights for a youth with behavior data
2. Verify response includes:
   - Calculated statistics (mean, median, std dev)
   - Trend analysis with numbers
   - Data-driven recommendations

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. **Data visualization suggestions**: AI could recommend chart types based on data
2. **Comparative analysis**: Compare youth performance across cohorts
3. **Predictive modeling**: Forecast behavior trends based on historical data
4. **Template expansion**: Pre-defined templates for common note types
5. **Multi-field expansion**: Expand multiple brief fields at once

## Configuration

No environment variable changes required. The AI continues to use:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: Model to use (default: gpt-4o-mini)
- `OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS`: Max tokens per request (default: 2000)

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert these changes:
1. The changes are isolated to specific functions and prompts
2. No database schema changes were made
3. No breaking changes to API contracts
4. Simply restore the previous versions of the modified files
