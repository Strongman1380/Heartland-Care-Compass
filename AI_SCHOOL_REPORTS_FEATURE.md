# AI-Powered School Reports Feature

## Overview
Added comprehensive AI analysis generation capabilities to the School Print Reports system, allowing staff to automatically generate professional academic insights, recommendations, and program-wide analysis based on student performance data.

## What Was Added

### 1. AI Analysis Functions

#### `generateAIAnalysis()`
Generates detailed academic progress analysis for **individual students**:
- **Input Data**:
  - Student's weekly average score (0-4 scale)
  - Daily scores for the period
  - Academic profile (grade, school, IEP status)
  - Related incidents during period
  
- **AI-Generated Output**:
  - **Progress Notes**: 2-3 sentence performance summary
  - **Academic Strengths**: 2-3 bullet points highlighting what student does well
  - **Areas for Improvement**: 2-3 specific areas needing attention
  - **Recommendations**: 3-4 actionable next steps for teachers/staff

- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses `aiService.queryData()` with GPT-4o-mini model
  - Requests structured JSON response for easy parsing
  - Falls back to plain text if JSON parsing fails
  - Populates all 4 text fields automatically
  - Shows loading state and toast notifications

#### `generateWeeklyAIAnalysis()`
Generates program-wide analysis for **all students**:
- **Input Data**:
  - All student averages and performance levels
  - Overall program average
  - Total students tracked
  
- **AI-Generated Output**:
  - 3-4 paragraph professional summary including:
    - Overall program performance assessment
    - Standout students and achievements
    - Areas of concern across the program
    - Recommended action items for staff
    - Trends and patterns observed

- **Technical Details**:
  - Analyzes entire cohort performance
  - Generates comprehensive narrative report
  - Stored in `weeklyAnalysis` state
  - Displays in both control panel preview and printed report

### 2. User Interface Additions

#### Individual Student Report
**Location**: Control panel when "Individual Student Progress Report" is selected

**New Button**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✨ Generate AI Analysis             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Appears after student selection
- Disabled when no student data or already generating
- Button text changes to "Generating..." during processing
- Automatically fills all 4 text areas (Strengths, Improvements, Notes, Recommendations)

#### Weekly Average Report
**Location**: Control panel when "Weekly Average Report" is selected

**New Button**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✨ Generate AI Weekly Analysis      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Full-width button in control panel
- Only visible when data exists
- Shows preview of generated analysis in blue info box
- Preview indicates "will appear in report"

**New Report Section**:
```
╔════════════════════════════════════╗
║ ✨ Program Analysis & Insights     ║
╠════════════════════════════════════╣
║ [AI-generated analysis appears     ║
║  here as formatted paragraphs]     ║
╚════════════════════════════════════╝
```

- Blue-highlighted section at end of weekly report
- Only appears when analysis has been generated
- Professional formatting with proper spacing
- Prints nicely in PDF exports

### 3. State Management

Added 3 new state variables:
```typescript
const [generatingAI, setGeneratingAI] = useState(false)
const [weeklyAnalysis, setWeeklyAnalysis] = useState('')
```

- `generatingAI`: Loading state for both generation functions
- `weeklyAnalysis`: Stores program-wide analysis text

### 4. Import Additions

```typescript
import { aiService } from '@/services/ai-service'
import { Sparkles } from 'lucide-react'
```

## How It Works

### For Individual Students:
1. Staff selects "Individual Student Progress Report"
2. Chooses student from dropdown
3. Sets date range
4. Clicks "✨ Generate AI Analysis" button
5. AI analyzes:
   - Daily scores and averages
   - Academic profile information
   - Related incidents
6. Automatically fills all 4 text fields
7. Staff can edit AI suggestions before printing
8. Export to PDF with all analysis included

### For Weekly Program Reports:
1. Staff selects "Weekly Average Report"
2. Sets date range
3. Clicks "✨ Generate AI Weekly Analysis" button
4. AI analyzes entire program performance
5. Generates 3-4 paragraph professional summary
6. Preview appears in control panel
7. Analysis appears in exported report
8. Export to PDF with insights included

## Benefits

### For Staff:
- **Time Savings**: Automatic generation of professional academic analysis
- **Consistency**: Standardized format and quality across all reports
- **Insights**: AI identifies patterns and trends staff might miss
- **Professionalism**: Well-written, detailed reports for stakeholders

### For Students:
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Detailed strengths and improvement areas
- **Actionable Plans**: Specific, concrete recommendations
- **Recognition**: Accomplishments highlighted automatically
- **Support**: Issues identified early with suggested interventions

### For Administration:

- **Data-Driven Decisions**: AI identifies trends and patterns
- **Quality Reports**: Professional documentation for funding/compliance
- **Efficiency**: Faster report generation without sacrificing quality

## Data Sources

The AI analysis incorporates:
- ✅ Daily academic scores (0-4 scale)
- ✅ Weekly averages
- ✅ Student academic profiles (grade, school, IEP)
- ✅ School incident reports (behavior context)
- ✅ Performance trends over time
- ✅ Program-wide statistics

## Error Handling

- Toast notifications for missing data
- Graceful fallback if JSON parsing fails
