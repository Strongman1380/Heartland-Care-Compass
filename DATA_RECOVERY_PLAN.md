# School Scores Data Recovery Plan

## üîç Current Situation

**Finding:** No school scores found in localStorage under the key `heartland_school_scores`

This means one of the following happened:
1. ‚úÖ Data was only saved to Supabase (not localStorage)
2. ‚úÖ localStorage was cleared at some point
3. ‚úÖ Data is stored under a different key
4. ‚úÖ Data was never entered (fresh install)

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Recovery Process

### Step 1: Check All localStorage Keys

I've updated the `check-localStorage.html` tool with a new button:

1. **Open** `check-localStorage.html` in your browser
2. **Click** "üîë Show All Keys"
3. **Look for** any keys that might contain school data:
   - Keys with "school" in the name
   - Keys with "score" in the name
   - Keys with "academic" in the name
   - Any other suspicious keys

**If you find data:** Click "View" to see if it contains your scores.

---

### Step 2: Check Supabase Database

Your data might be in Supabase instead of localStorage. Here's how to check:

#### Option A: Check via Supabase Dashboard

1. **Go to** https://supabase.com
2. **Log in** to your account
3. **Select** your project
4. **Click** "Table Editor" in the left sidebar
5. **Look for** the `school_daily_scores` table
6. **If it exists:** Click it to see if there's data
7. **If it doesn't exist:** The data was never synced to Supabase

#### Option B: Check via SQL Query

1. In Supabase, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run this query:

```sql
-- Check if table exists
SELECT EXISTS (
   SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name = 'school_daily_scores'
);

-- If true, check for data
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_scores FROM school_daily_scores;

-- View all data
SELECT * FROM school_daily_scores ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 100;
```

---

### Step 3: Determine What Happened

Based on what you find:

#### Scenario A: Data is in Supabase
**What happened:** Data was saved to Supabase but the localStorage sync failed due to the bug.

**Solution:**
1. Create the `school_daily_scores` table (if it doesn't exist)
2. Refresh the app
3. The data will sync from Supabase to localStorage automatically
4. Your scores will reappear!

#### Scenario B: Data is in localStorage under a different key
**What happened:** The storage key changed at some point.

**Solution:**
1. Identify the correct key using the "Show All Keys" button
2. Copy the data
3. Save it under the correct key: `heartland_school_scores`
4. Refresh the app

#### Scenario C: Data is nowhere
**What happened:** Either:
- The data was never entered
- localStorage was cleared and Supabase table doesn't exist
- The bug prevented data from being saved

**Solution:**
- Unfortunately, the data may be lost
- You'll need to re-enter the scores
- Once the Supabase table is created, future data will be backed up

## üîß Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Create Supabase Table (Prevents Future Data Loss)

Even if your data is lost, create the table now to prevent this from happening again:

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the SQL from `CREATE_SCHOOL_SCORES_TABLE.md`
3. Future scores will be backed up to Supabase

### Fix 2: Enable Automatic Backups

Once the table is created, the app will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Save to localStorage (immediate)
- ‚úÖ Save to Supabase (backup)
- ‚úÖ Sync from Supabase on page load
- ‚úÖ Merge data from both sources

---

## üéØ Most Likely Scenario

Based on the error logs you showed me, here's what probably happened:

1. **Before the bug:** You entered school scores
2. **The bug occurred:** Infinite loop prevented localStorage writes
3. **Supabase sync failed:** Table doesn't exist (404 errors)
4. **Result:** Data was never saved anywhere

**The good news:** The bug is now fixed, so this won't happen again!

**The bad news:** The data from before the fix may be lost.

## üìä Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. ‚úÖ **Check localStorage keys** (use the updated tool)
2. ‚úÖ **Check Supabase** (see if table exists and has data)
3. ‚úÖ **Create the Supabase table** (prevent future data loss)
4. ‚úÖ **Test the fix** (enter a new score and verify it saves)

### Long-term Actions:

1. ‚úÖ **Set up regular backups** (export localStorage data weekly)
2. ‚úÖ **Monitor console** for any new errors
3. ‚úÖ **Verify Supabase sync** is working after creating the table

---

## üÜò If You Need the Data Urgently

### Check Browser History/Cache

If you have browser backups or Time Machine backups:

1. **Mac:** Check Time Machine for browser profile backups
2. **Windows:** Check File History or System Restore
3. **Browser:** Some browsers keep localStorage backups

### Check Other Browsers/Devices

If you accessed the app from multiple browsers or devices:

1. Check each browser's localStorage
2. Check mobile devices if you used the app there
3. The data might still exist on another device

### Check Supabase Logs

If you have Supabase logging enabled:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
2. Look for any successful INSERT operations
3. This will tell you if data was ever saved to Supabase

## üìù Summary

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Bug is fixed (no more infinite loops)
- ‚úÖ App is functioning normally
- ‚ùå No school scores in localStorage
- ‚ùì Unknown if data exists in Supabase

**Action Required:**
1. Check all localStorage keys
2. Check Supabase for data
3. Create Supabase table (if it doesn't exist)
4. Test by entering new scores

**Expected Outcome:**
- If data is in Supabase: It will sync back to localStorage
- If data is lost: You'll need to re-enter it (but it won't be lost again)
- Future data: Will be safely backed up to both localStorage and Supabase

## üí° Prevention for the Future

Once the Supabase table is created:

1. **Automatic dual-save:** Every score saves to both localStorage AND Supabase
2. **Automatic sync:** On page load, data syncs from Supabase
3. **Graceful degradation:** If Supabase is down, localStorage still works
4. **No data loss:** Even if localStorage is cleared, data is in Supabase

**This is exactly why the hybrid approach exists!** Once the table is created, you'll have redundancy.

**Next:** Use the updated `check-localStorage.html` tool to check all keys, then check Supabase to see if the data exists there.
