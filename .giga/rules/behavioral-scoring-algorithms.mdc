Core Behavioral Assessment System
Importance Score: 95

1. Domain-Based Scoring Model
- Four key behavioral domains tracked:
  * Peer Interaction (0-4 scale)
  * Adult Interaction (0-4 scale)
  * Investment Level (0-4 scale)
  * Deal with Authority (0-4 scale)
- Real-time average calculations across domains
- Historical trend analysis with AI-enhanced assessments

2. Level Progression System
- 10-level advancement structure
- Points-based calculations:
  * Daily point limits (0-105)
  * Level-specific point thresholds
  * Custom privilege requirements per level
- Automatic level promotion/demotion logic
- Orientation phase handling

3. Risk Assessment Algorithm
- Eight domain comprehensive evaluation
- Domain-specific weighted scoring
- Risk level thresholds:
  * Low: 0-25%
  * Moderate: 26-50%
  * High: 51-75%
  * Critical: 76-100%
- Automatic placement level recommendations (1-4)

4. AI-Enhanced Behavioral Analysis
- Case note sentiment analysis across domains
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Treatment effectiveness scoring
- Risk prediction modeling
- Automated insight generation

Key Files:
- src/components/behavior/EnhancedBehaviorCard.tsx
- src/utils/levelSystem.ts
- src/utils/kpiCaseNoteAi.ts
- src/services/aiService.ts

The behavioral scoring system integrates multiple assessment layers:
- Daily point tracking
- Domain-based evaluations
- Risk assessments
- Level progression
- AI-enhanced analysis

This creates a comprehensive framework for monitoring and evaluating youth behavior while maintaining compliance with residential care facility requirements.
